# Azure Notification Hubs (ANS)?

- Azure Notification Hubs is a fully managed push notification service that enables you to send instant push messages to millions of mobile devices, across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Windows, etc.) — all from a single API.
- Think of it as a bridge between your app backend and mobile platform notification systems, such as:
  -  Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)
  -  Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) (for Android)
  -  Windows Push Notification Service (WNS)
  -  Huawei Push Kit, etc.
