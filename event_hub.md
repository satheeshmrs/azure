# Azure Event Hubs,
- which is a core building block for real-time data streaming and event ingestion on Azure 🚀
  - If Service Bus is about reliable messaging and workflows,
  - then Event Hub is about high-throughput event streaming and analytics.
# What Is Azure Event Hubs?
 - Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service — part of the Azure Messaging family.
 - It can collect, buffer, and deliver millions of events per second from devices, apps, or services in real time.
 - Think of it as Azure’s version of Kafka-as-a-service — a high-scale event ingestion pipeline for telemetry, logs, IoT data, and analytics.

# Core Concept:
| Concept	| Description| 
| -------|-------------|
| Event Hub Namespace	| A container for one or more Event Hubs (like a Kafka cluster).| 
| Event Hub | 	A specific stream (like a Kafka topic).| 
| Partition	| A unit of parallelism — events are distributed across partitions for scaling.| 
| Consumer Group	| A view of the event stream — each consumer group reads independently.| 
| Event Producer	| Sends (publishes) events to the Event Hub.| 
| Event Consumer	| Reads (subscribes) to events from the Event Hub.| 

# When to Use Event Hubs
| Use Case	| Example|
| -------|-------------|
| Telemetry ingestion | Collecting logs from thousands of devices or microservices|
| Real-time analytics | Streaming events to Azure Stream Analytics or Databricks|
| Event-driven processing| Triggers in Functions or Spark jobs|
| IoT streaming | Sensor and telemetry data from IoT devices|
| Integration with Kafka | Replacing or extending on-prem Kafka clusters| 

# Event Hubs Architecture Overview

[ Consumer Group B ] → Stream Processor B

# Key Features

| Feature	| Description| 
| -------|-------------|
|Massive throughput	| Millions of events per second|
|Low latency	| Near real-time ingestion|
|Partitioned consumers	| Parallel reads via partitions|
|Durable storage	| Events stored up to 90 days |
|Capture	| Auto-archive to Azure Blob Storage or Data Lake |
|Kafka-compatible endpoint	| Can use Kafka APIs directly|
|Auto-scaling	Automatically | adjusts throughput units|
|Geo-disaster recovery	| Namespace-level replication for resilience |


# Supported Protocols

- Azure Event Hubs supports multiple protocols for producers and consumers.

| Protocol	| Description	Used For| 
| -------|-------------|
| AMQP 1.0	| Default protocol for Azure SDKs	Most common, reliable| 
| HTTPS REST API	| Lightweight API	Low-frequency ingestion or management| 
| Kafka 1.0 API	| Kafka-compatible endpoint	Allows Kafka clients to connect natively| 
| Apache Avro	Event | serialization format	Efficient, compact, schema-friendly| 


# Overview: High-Level Analogy
| Concept	| Service Bus	| Event Hubs| 
| -------|-------------|-------------|
| Publisher / Producer	| Sends messages to a Queue or Topic	| Sends events to an Event Hub| 
| Subscriber	| A Subscription under a Topic	| ❌ Not applicable| 
| Consumer	| The app that reads from a Queue or Subscription | 	The app that reads from a Partition| 
| Consumer Group	❌|  Not applicable	| A view of the event stream for one or more consumers| 

# IF consumer A reads, consumer B in the same group receive same message or not?
- No — in Azure Event Hubs, if Consumer A reads a message, Consumer B in the same consumer group will not receive the same message.
- Only one consumer per partition per consumer group reads a given event.


Let’s say your Event Hub has 4 partitions, and your consumer group = “AnalyticsGroup”.

You deploy two consumers within that group:

Partition	Assigned Consumer
Partition 0	Consumer A
Partition 1	Consumer A
Partition 2	Consumer B
Partition 3	Consumer B

```css
Event Hub: TelemetryStream
 ├── Partition 0
 ├── Partition 1
 ├── Partition 2
 └── Partition 3

Consumer Group A: Analytics
 ├── Consumer A1 → P0, P1
 └── Consumer A2 → P2, P3

Consumer Group B: Monitoring
 ├── Consumer B1 → P0, P1
 └── Consumer B2 → P2, P3

```
